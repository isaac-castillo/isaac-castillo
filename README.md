### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub.
Here you can find some of the projects I have been working on.

rpg2: This is an on-going project designed to create an RPG. I've been doing my best applying best practices, SOLID principles, and writing clean code in modern C++17. This project has continuous integration, automatic builds, and is largely written with test driven development (TDD) practices.

opengl-maze-program: This is a 3D maze generator written in OpenGL. It's still in its early alpha stages. It's a bit of a mess right now, but there are some gems in there. Also written in C++17.  

raytracer: A raytracer written in C++. This has a suite of unit testing and is largely complete. It features the ability to read in a scene file, and render it appropriately. Designed with Clean code practices in mind, and test driven development.

ezlang: A language and interpreter written in Haskell. This is a fork of a school project, but I like having it on here since it's very cool, and I enjoyed working with Haskell a lot. 

graphit: My first project ever - a graphing calculator written in Java.
